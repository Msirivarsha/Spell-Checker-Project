# Spell Checker Using Probabilistic Model

## Project Overview
This project implements a spell checker using a probabilistic model. It utilizes a large text corpus to find the probability distribution of words and generates potential corrections for misspelled words by applying various edits. The model can suggest corrections based on both single and double edit distances.

## Steps Involved
